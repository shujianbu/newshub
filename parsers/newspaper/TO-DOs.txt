1. Build seperate tables in the database for Chinese and English articles
   - fetch.py detect.py and copare.py

2. Write the script for running the project:
   - delete the generated output.html file
   - run fetch.py to get new articles
   - get DB_urls and DB_stored
   - run detect.py to get updates
   - get DB_updates
   - run compare.py

3. Name the generated output.html file, otherwise it will keep content from previous runs.
   Or we can simply delete the output.html file in the script
