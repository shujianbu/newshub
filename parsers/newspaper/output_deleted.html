Title: In Malda, it’s still all about Ghani Khan</span>

The Congress campaign in the border district of Malda begins and ends with A B A Ghani Khan Choudhury. Ghani Khan’s brother Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury is the Congress candidate from Malda South and Mausam Benazir Noor, his niece, is the party candidate from Malda North. As uncle and niece campaign for the April 24 election, they bank heavily on the work that Ghani Khan did as a minister in the state and later as a minister in Indira Gandhi’s Cabinet.

So while Abu Hasem takes credit for getting the Ghani Khan Institute of Engineering and Technology for Malda, he doesn’t forget to mention that it was his family and the “great Ghani Khan” who built a railway equipment manufacturing factory in Malda town.

Similarly, Mausam Benazir Noor rattles off a string of development programmes that she has undertaken for Malda — building the Mahananda embankment, roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana, widening of national highways, arranging drinking water — but not before talking about how her uncle Ghani Khan got NTPC to set up a power plant here and got Malda its model railway station.

“What’s wrong in flaunting the work that my brother has done? Who can deny that? But we have carried forward his work and we are sure we will win,’’ says Abu Hasem, sitting at his ancestral house in Kotwali.

Mausam, who is president of the West Bengal Youth Congress, too sees nothing wrong in invoking her late uncle’s legacy. “Nobody can deny what he has done for Malda. But we are not sitting back. We are also talking about what we have done,’’ says Mausam as she leaves the family home for her roadshow at Bhabuk in old Malda.

But her Trinamool Congress rival, singer Saumitra Roy, says the Ghani magic won’t work any longer in Malda. “You can not live off your legacy. Both the uncle and niece have lost touch with the people. I have come here to talk about the future, not cling on to the past,’’ says Roy.

 Though both Hasem Khan and Mausam admit that they see a “Modi buzz” in Malda, they claim that the BJP won’t make inroads into the Muslim-dominated district.

Muslims form 38 per cent of the 14.22 lakh voters in Malda North while Malda South has 62 per cent Muslim voters. “Muslims will never vote for the BJP. They are traditional Congress voters,” said an aide of Mausam.

In the 2009 elections, for which the Congress and Trinamool Congress were in an alliance, Mausam got 4,40,264 votes in Malda North while the CPM’s Sailen Sarkar got 3,80,123 votes. The BJP’s Amlan Bhaduri came third. In Malda South too, the BJP came third. This time, with the Congress and the Trinamool fighting separately, the BJP hopes to put up a tough fight.

She had not been sent to her husband's place as her 'gauna' had not been performed. She stayed with her parents at Bhadausi village where her husband occasionally visited her. 



 Late on Sunday night, Shiv Narayan visited Bhadausi to attend a marriage where his wife and mother were also present. In the wee hours on Monday, he went to sleep at his in-laws' house with his three friends. His wife also accompanied him while her mother, Sunita Devi, stayed back. When Sunita Devi reached home around 8 am on Monday, she found to her horror her daughter lying in a pool of blood with her neck slit. 



 In her complaint to the police, Sunita Devi said her son-in-law and his three friends gangraped her daughter after which they killed her with a sharp knife. She stated they also broke open a box and took away Rs 10,000 in cash and gold jewellery. She added there was nothing wrong between the couple and she failed to understand why Shiv Narayan committed such a heinous crime The accused has been at large after committing the crime.

The police officer said a police team had been sent to the accused persons' village in Lakhisarai district and the accused will soon be arrested.

Title: Classical artistes take a political stance, spark debate</span> 
</div>

<div class="articleDiff"> 
NEW DELHI: Chhanulal Mishra is the staple star turn on the last day of Varanasi's annual Sankat Mochan music festival. A local boy, he has a bottomless treasure of Benarasi thumris, chaitis and kajris in his portfolio; his concerts are equal parts music and gyan. 



 This year the buzz around him spilt in another direction. The day before his recital he agreed to be the proposer for Narendra Modi's nomination, claiming to be an admirer of the leader. He left some fans fuming. "Why?" sputtered one. "Why not? Why shouldn't an artiste have a political view?" countered festival regular Shailaja Khanna. "Isn't his art giving him enough? Lanka mein gaye to Ravan se darna padega (if you go to Lanka, you will have to fear Ravan as well)," sniped a senior vocalist. The man himself refuses to be provoked. "I don't engage with politics but with personalities. BJP asked me respectfully. Modi has abhiman, not swabhiman. That is good enough for me to endorse him," says Mishra. 



 Another classical star, santoor master Shiv Kumar Sharma, went to Amritsar to campaign for friend Arun Jaitley. This perhaps is the first election to have two prominent ustads engage in politics. 



 So is the community of classical artistes shedding its insularity to articulate political views? The image of the aloof musician with no other concern than riyaaz is changing. Carnatic vocalist TM Krishna says it's a positive and signifi cant change. "That politicians want classical musicians as campaigners is important recognition," says Krishna, who has written strongly against right-wing politics. Does this compromise integrity, artistic freedom? Krishna says theoretically an artist can take a clear political stand and retain artistic integrity. "But will Shivji be able to publicly condemn BJP if one of its right-wing partners assaults a dancer or painter? That's the litmus test. Unfortunately, history shows us artistes are unable to separate their sense of artistic freedom and political preferences." 



 Not that classical arts are immune to power of politics. State patronage of classical arts is a minuscule pie — competition for patronage intense, often vicious. Culture circuits are full of stories of artistes attaching themselves to patrons to lobbying for positions in culture bodies. But clear political alignment is new. 



 Hindustani vocalist Vidya Shah believes music should not transgress into politics. "That doesn't mean we cannot use music to dissent, seek solidarity or seek change. But taking a political position is polarizing because then you worry about doing what your patron wants." 



 What the nature of this political engagement should be is being debated. Rahul Deshpande, one of Pune's whizkid Hindustani vocalists, says he has often questioned local leaders and administrators on city issues and was among a citizens group that campaigned to increase turnout. But he's wary of active politics. "I admire Modi's administrative skills but that is about it. I would rather do my bit and stick to music," he says. 



 How much of the party line artistes like Sharma and Mishra subscribe to remains unclear. "They should be steady in their ideological stand even if I don't agree with it. This is a critical election — there can be no fence sitting," says Kathak dancer Aditi Mangaldas.

HYDERABAD: Vote, and you could win a Nano! Voters of Medak district of Telangana can expect a windfall of prizes - but only if they cast their vote in the elections on April 30.



 No, it is not political parties or candidates which are making such promises to lure voters. It is the district administration itself which has announced what it calls 'Votaru Panduga (Voters festival)' to encourage people to exercise their franchise.



 Prizes will be given away at the village level, towns and industrial areas. However, there is a rider. The voter turn out should be up to 95 per cent in the villages, and 92 per cent in towns or industrial areas, to be considered for prizes.



 All that voters will have to do is drop their voter slip into a basket which will be kept at the polling booth, after they cast their vote. If there is more than 95 per cent polling in a village, a draw will be taken and 10 people of the village will get gifts costing Rs 1,200 each. It is the same at the towns and industrial estate.



 But a big bonanza awaits them when the final draw will be taken on May 9 for the entire districts. The villagers, towns and industrial estates where the polling exceeds more than 90 per cent will be eligible for the big draw.



 An official of Medak district said expensive gifts await those whose names are picked in the final draw. The gifts include LED televisions, motorbike, washing machines, laptops and even a Nano car.



 Official sources said the district administration will make use of special funds to foot the bill to give away the prizes.



 "The idea is to increase the voter turn out. We want more people to come out and exercise their franchise. This is what the Election Commission has asked us to do. To get people to vote, we have come up with a scheme," an official said.



 In the 2009 elections, the voter turnout was 68 per cent and officials want it to touch 95 per cent in the 2014 elections. In Medak district, the administration has publicized the scheme in every town and in the villages. There are posters and hoardings everywhere to make the voters aware of the scheme.

CUDDALORE: Police have arrested a third-year engineering student of a private college in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu on charges of sodomizing and murdering his 13-year-old cousin. The engineering student allegedly killed the boy fearing that the teenager would disclose his pornography addiction to others.



 T Tamilvelan, 13, an Class VIII student at a government school in Papanthope village under Kattumannarkoil police station limits, was found dead with his throat slit in a casuarinas grove on April 13. The Kattumannarkoil police registered a case and began investigations.



 The police could not make any major breakthrough until they got a vital clue that the deceased boy had been often spotted with his cousin, K Satish, 22, residing in the same locality and pursuing third year engineering at a private engineering college in Ariyalur.



 The police detained the student. On sustained inquiries, Satish broke down and admitted that he had murdered his cousin fearing that he would disclose his pornography addiction to others. Satish said he used to watch pornography on his laptop and mobile phone and also used to play it for his minor cousin. He admitted that he used to have sex with his cousin, police said.



 Tamilvelan disclosed to his classmates that Satish was addicted to pornography and had large volumes of adult content in his mobile phone and laptop, following which several students started requesting Satish to show them the porn contents.



 Enraged over this, Satish decided to eliminate his cousin. He invited Tamilvelan to a nearby casuarinas grove promising to play a porn movie. When they reached the grove, he played a pornographic content in his mobile phone for Tamilvelan and attacked the minor boy. He slit the boy's throat using a knife and in the struggle the teenager bit the fingers of his cousin.



 Satish dumped the dead body in the grove and escaped. He visited a hospital in Meensuruti and underwent treatment claiming that a dog had bitten him on the fingers.



 The police produced Satish before a local court which remanded him in judicial custody on Monday.

BANGALORE: An estimated 70 per cent of the electorate cast their vote in the re-polling held on Tuesday at 12 polling stations across nine Lok Sabha constituencies in Karnataka. 



 "We have estimated 65 to 70 per cent voter turnout at re-polling held in 12 polling stations today," Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer Anil Kumar Jha told PTI. 



 "Polling was normal and peaceful," he added. The CEO had recommended re-polling at 11 polling stations due to technical problems in EVMs and polling station at Turuvekere in Tumkur Lok Sabha constituency because of human error committed by election officials. 



 Re-polling took place in polling stations in Lok Sabha constituencies of Tumkur, Haveri, Bagalkot, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Raichur, Bidar, Shimoga and Hassan. 



 All 28 Lok Sabha constituencies in Karnataka went to polls on April 17 in a single phase, registering an overall 67.28 per cent polling. 



 CEO had earlier suspended four election officials for trying to handle the voting machine in violation of electoral laws.

<div class="articleDiff"> 
PORT OF SPAIN: Denesh Ramdin was appointed captain of the West Indies Test side in place of Darren Sammy and the wicketkeeper-batsman's first assignment will be the home series against New Zealand beginning next month. 



 Sammy will continue to be T20 captain meaning West Indies have separate skippers for all three formats. 



 "Denesh Ramdin, the Wicket-keeper/Batsman, has been named new Test Match Captain of the West Indies Team. Congrats to him on the appointment," the West Indies Cricket Board wrote on its Twitter handle. 



 "The WICB also thanks Darren Sammy for his time at the helm as Test Match Captain from November 2010. He will remain as T20 Captain," the board added. 



 Ramdin has led the national side in three T20s and an ODI. His has got the experience of captaining Trinidad & Tobago in 37 matches across all formats, taking T&T to the semifinal of the Regional Four Day Competition this season. 



 Sammy, who was appointed captain in 2010, was relieved of his one-day duties in 2013 and was replaced by all-rounder Dwayne Bravo. 



 Sammy's tenure as Test captain began in November 2010 when West Indies drew a three-match series against the hosts Sri Lanka. He led West Indies to series victories twice over Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and New Zealand. 



 But disastrous results on the Test tours of India and New Zealand last year raised doubts over his leadership abilities and his individual failure as an all-rounder has also not helped his case.

PORT OF SPAIN: Denesh Ramdin was appointed captain of the West Indies Test side in place of Darren Sammy and the wicketkeeper-batsman's first assignment will be the home series against New Zealand beginning next month. 



 Sammy will continue to be T20 captain meaning West Indies have separate skippers for all three formats. 



 "Denesh Ramdin, the Wicket-keeper/Batsman, has been named new Test Match Captain of the West Indies Team. Congrats to him on the appointment," the West Indies Cricket Board wrote on its Twitter handle. 



 "The WICB also thanks Darren Sammy for his time at the helm as Test Match Captain from November 2010. He will remain as T20 Captain," the board added. 



 Ramdin has led the national side in three T20s and an ODI. His has got the experience of captaining Trinidad & Tobago in 37 matches across all formats, taking T&T to the semifinal of the Regional Four Day Competition this season. 



 Sammy, who was appointed captain in 2010, was relieved of his one-day duties in 2013 and was replaced by all-rounder Dwayne Bravo. 



 Sammy's tenure as Test captain began in November 2010 when West Indies drew a three-match series against the hosts Sri Lanka. He led West Indies to series victories twice over Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and New Zealand. 



 But disastrous results on the Test tours of India and New Zealand last year raised doubts over his leadership abilities and his individual failure as an all-rounder has also not helped his case.

Title: Messi seeks ultimate prize with World Cup win</span>

BUENOS AIRES: After a spectacular haul of trophies with Barcelona, Lionel Messi has a chance to lead Argentina to glory on the World Cup stage and build on his reputation as one of the all-time greats. 



 The four-times World Player of the Year has won a glittering array of club silverware and has established himself as one of the finest footballers to grace the game, but some believe he must win the World Cup before he can be hailed as a true great. 



 Many others believe, at the age of 26 - he turns 27 during the tournament on June 24 - he already has. 



 Messi is inevitably compared with Diego Maradona, who inspired the nation to victory at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, and will travel to Brazil with considerable expectation on his shoulders. 



 A lot will depend on how well he copes with the pressure and with his shrugs off an out-of-character indifferent spell towards the end of the Spanish season. 



 At Barcelona he was a carefree youngster who came through the youth ranks earning plenty of praise but it never went to his head. He enjoyed playing football, that was his outlet to express himself and his confidence on the pitch was in marked contrast to his generally shy personality. 



 Whether there were millions watching around the world, it didn't seem to matter to him as he was self-absorbed in outwitting the opposition with his trickery. 



 Now in his mid-twenties and a father to an infant son, he carries the responsibility of being the talisman for Barcelona and he is at a club where the fans worship him for what he has already delivered. 



 It is different story for the Albiceleste. During a fruitful qualifying campaign, when he netted 10 goals, Argentines warmed to him but still Messi has to measure up to Maradona. 



 The former Argentina captain and coach is an idol in his native country as many identify with him, the boy who emerged from the slums and restored national pride, notably with the two goals that knocked out England in the quarterfinals in Mexico in 1986. 



 Messi will never have that connection with the fans, having been brought up in Spain after clubs back home allowed him to slip through their fingers. 



 It was the Catalan side that put their faith in him as a 13-year-old and paid for him to have the growth hormone treatment that he needed to realise his full potential. 



LOOKING GOOD 



 Coach Alejandro Sabella has built his side around Messi to a far greater extent than his predecessors and now at the peak of his career this could well be his best chance to emulate Maradona and bring the World Cup home. 



 An attack-minded Argentina generally play with Messi alongside close friend Sergio Aguero in attack and Barca team mate Javier Mascherano controlling play in the middle. 



 "The team is looking good and we are getting on well together but in a World Cup anything can happen, it is very difficult," Messi said in the bulld-up to the finals. 



 "The games at the World Cup are totally different. First of all the atmosphere is not like anything else. While the Champions League is great, the World Cup is special." 



 Messi is hoping to be 100 percent fit in Brazil having had a difficult 2013 due to a series of hamstring injuries. 



 He spent a couple of months on the sidelines before returning in January and this could work in Argentina's favour as he may arrive fresher than other players. 



 "Apart from the obvious down side, it was good for me physically to have a two month break," Messi said. 



 "I was very relaxed working at the Argentine FA facilities. Then after that I went home to Rosario and worked hard there as well, so everything was good. 



 "To be home with friends and family, just to be there after so much time, is good for me."

Title: 5.5-inch iPhone delayed till 2015: Report</span>

NEW DELHI: iPhone fans may have to wait more to get their hands on the large-screen version of Apple's flagship smartphone. 



 The 5.5-inch version of Apple iPhone has been delayed till 2015 according to a report by Taiwan's Industrial and Commercial Times. The report mentions that the Cupertino giant is struggling to find a battery that could fit in the new iPhone's thin form factor. Earlier, an analyst had suggested that the 5.5-inch iPhone would be launched in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, a Reuters report had stated that the 5.5-inch version of the iPhone could be delayed because of difficulties with in-cell production technology. 



 As per the report, Apple suppliers are calling the 5.5-inch iPhone, 'iPhone Air' and not iPhone 6, but it's not certain that this will be the final name for the smartphone. It won't be surprising if Apple adds the 'Air' suffix to the name of the phone given that it is rumoured to sport a very thin profile. 



 iPhone 6 is said to have a 64-bit A8 processor, 1GB RAM, LTPS LCD display panels, optical image stabilization, Touch ID fingerprint sensor, metal casings and NFC. The upcoming iPhones are expected to be 6.5-7mm thick and have 10-20% narrower bezels around the screen. Only the 64GB version of the 5.5-inch iPhone will have sapphire glass, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

Bitcoins are being used by paedophiles to trade in videos of sickening child abuse, according to one of Europe's police officers. 



 Rob Wainwright the director of Europol, Europe's premier law enforcement agency, said the untraceable nature of the online currency meant that paedophiles were able to trade images of child abuse and pay for live webcam shows, without fear of reprisal. 



 He said, "Sorry, but it's happening online and it's extremely difficult for us to identify the criminals." According to Wainwright, those that trade in videos of child abuse were hidden behind the smokescreen of the bitcoin and, as a result, the content of the videos was becoming increasingly more deprived. 



 He said, "The level of depravity seems to be descending year on year, frankly, including what seems to be in vogue now, which is live webcam 'shows' of toddlers not just being raped but being burnt with cigarettes." This is another example of the controversial online currency, which is based on mathematical formulae and is independent from any national bank, being used to fund illegal activity. 



 In October last year, the website Silk Road was closed down by the FBI after it was found that users were able to trade in drugs and other illegal goods with bitcoins and not be traced. The suspected founder Ross William Ulbricht was held and the equivalent of $28 million worth of bitcoins were taken from him.

[TAIPEI] Shanghai Lujiazui Finance & Trade will take over the 50 per cent stake of Cathay Financial Holdings' insurance tie-up in China from China Eastern Airlines.

Cathay Financial had been seeking a buyer to take over the stake for months. Having the new partner would help it better expand in the mainland's huge but competitive life insurance market.

The transaction has gained Chinese regulatory approval, Cathay Financial said in a statement late on Tuesday.

Shares of Cathay Financial rose 0.3 per cent by 0145 GMT, trailing the broader market's 0.4 per cent advance. Shares in Shanghai Lujiazui were down 1.8 per cent. - Reuters

Wage pressures will intensify over the rest of this year, as strong hiring intentions continue to butt up against a tight labour market, Singapore's central bank warned on Tuesday.

With productivity growth likely to provide only a modest offset to this, Singapore's unit labour cost (ULC) is expected to rise by another three per cent in 2014, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in its twice-yearly Macroeconomic Review.

The ULC rise moderated from 5.2 per cent in 2012 to 3.1 per cent in 2013.

MAS added: "Coupled with the hikes in foreign worker levies, ULC will rise further in the near term, although government subsidies such as the Wage Credit Scheme will continue to provide some offset."

<div class="articleDiff"> 
[SAN FRANCISCO] Google Inc said it has begun testing its self-driving cars on city streets, a crucial new phase in its quest to eventually make the technology a standard feature in automobiles.

After several years of testing self-driving cars on freeways, where driving conditions are more predictable, Google in the past year shifted its focus to city street driving, the company said in a post on its official blog on Monday.

Google said it has driven thousands of miles on the streets of Mountain View, California, a small suburban community where the company maintains its headquarters roughly 35 miles South of San Francisco. Google's driverless cars rely on video cameras, radar sensors, lasers and a database of information collected from manually driven cars to help navigation, according to the company. "A mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving, with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area," wrote Chris Urmson, the director of Google's self-driving car project in the blog post on Monday. "We've improved our software so it can detect hundreds of distinct objects simultaneously - pedestrians, buses, a stop sign held up by a crossing guard, or a cyclist making gestures that indicate a possible turn," Mr Urmson said.

Google is one of several companies, including automakers Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG's Audi and Toyota Motor Corp, testing self-driving car technology. Both Nissan and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG say they plan to start selling self-driving cars by 2020.

<div class="articleDiff"> 
The Merchant Of Venice often feels like two different plays in one. One half is coloured with the tragedy of the despised Jew and moneylender Shylock, and the other ablaze with its beautiful linguistic examinations of the law and loyalty, and what it means to keep a promise or to mete justice with mercy.

This makes it one of the most vexing of Shakespeare's 'problem plays', leading an ongoing debate between whether one ought to present it to a contemporary audience the way Shakespeare might have done to his 16th century audience - who must have taken great pleasure in seeing Shylock so reviled (then, Jews were made to live in ghettos) - or reimagine these uncomfortably disturbing elements of racism by muddying the waters of who is the hero and who is the devil.

This earnest production of Shakespeare In The Park is competent if rather vanilla; with less of the showier elements of previous years' editions, it is good to see Shakespeare's text in the spotlight, but it also means that more tedious scenes cannot be propped up by the shock and awe of special effects.

It is set in the present day, with some clever use of iPads and smartphones, and against a futuristic set reminiscent of the LED-studded and gaudy malls in Orchard Road. Bassanio (Perri Snowdon) seeks to marry the beautiful Portia (Julie Wee) and asks for a loan from his friend Antonio (Daniel Jenkins). With all his ships out as sea and no cash to lend him, Antonio turns to Shylock (Remesh Panicker), who demands a guarantee of what is arguably Shakespeare's most famous punishment - a pound of flesh.

<div class="articleDiff"> 
SEOUL (AFP) - North Korea readied a live-fire drill near its maritime border with South Korea on Tuesday - one month after a similar exercise triggered the exchange of hundreds of artillery shells across the disputed boundary.

"The North notified us there would be live-fire drills today north of the (border) near Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong islands," a Defence Ministry spokesman told AFP.

"Our military is fully prepared," the spokesman said, adding that South Korean fishing vessels had already been told to withdraw from the area.

North Korea carried out a similar drill on March 31 during which a number of shells dropped into South Korean territorial waters. The South responded, and the two rivals traded hundreds of rounds of live artillery fire, forcing South Korean islanders to take shelter.
