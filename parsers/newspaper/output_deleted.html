吳尊自從去年被曝結婚生子後，女兒的私照陸續被曝光，日前，吳尊竟然公開帶著女兒小“內內”參加某衛視的親子類電節目《爸爸回來了》的錄影，如此大膽把家庭和愛女公開示人，吳尊顯然是做好了萬全的準備。如今結婚四年，吳尊女兒“內內”也已經三歲了，不僅長得清秀甜美，更是吳尊心裏寵溺的小公主。在最新流出的節目片花中父女兩個還大穿親子裝一起逛超市，小“內內”留著齊劉海蘑菇頭，模樣十分討人喜歡，坐在吳尊的手推車裏十分乖巧，吳尊看上去也完全不像是一個已經當爹的人，兩人看起來更像是“兄妹”， 有了爸爸深深的寵愛，小“內內”調皮起來也就有恃無恐了，不僅跟爸爸大玩互咬手指的遊戲，還學爸爸吳尊扮起了大怪獸，兩人在一起玩得不亦樂乎。網友看後不禁感嘆：這是超級萌娃和超級奶爸的強強組合！    轉自：新浪新聞視頻
