Ghani Khan\u2019s brother Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury is the Congress candidate from Malda South and Mausam Benazir Noor, his niece, is the party candidate from Malda North. As uncle and niece campaign for the April 24 election, they bank heavily on the work that Ghani Khan did as a minister in the state and later as a minister in Indira Gandhi\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nSo while Abu Hasem takes credit for getting the Ghani Khan Institute of Engineering and Technology for Malda, he doesn\u2019t forget to mention that it was his family and the \u201cgreat Ghani Khan\u201d who built a railway equipment manufacturing factory in Malda town.\n\nSimilarly, Mausam Benazir Noor rattles off a string of development programmes that she has undertaken for Malda \u2014 building the Mahananda embankment, roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana, widening of national highways, arranging drinking water \u2014 but not before talking about how her uncle Ghani Khan got NTPC to set up a power plant here and got Malda its model railway station.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong in flaunting the work that my brother has done? Who can deny that? But we have carried forward his work and we are sure we will win,\u2019\u2019 says Abu Hasem, sitting at his ancestral house in Kotwali.\n\nMausam, who is president of the West Bengal Youth Congress, too sees nothing wrong in invoking her late uncle\u2019s legacy. \u201cNobody can deny what he has done for Malda. But we are not sitting back. We are also talking about what we have done,\u2019\u2019 says Mausam as she leaves the family home for her roadshow at Bhabuk in old Malda.\n\nBut her Trinamool Congress rival, singer Saumitra Roy, says the Ghani magic won\u2019t work any longer in Malda. \u201cYou can not live off your legacy. Both the uncle and niece have lost touch with the people. I have come here to talk about the future, not cling on to the past,\u2019\u2019 says Roy.\n\n Though both Hasem Khan and Mausam admit that they see a \u201cModi buzz\u201d in Malda, they claim that the BJP won\u2019t make inroads into the Muslim-dominated district.\n\nMuslims form 38 per cent of the 14.22 lakh voters in Malda North while Malda South has 62 per cent Muslim voters. \u201cMuslims will never vote for the BJP. They are traditional Congress voters,\u201d said an aide of Mausam.\n\nIn the 2009 elections, for which the Congress and Trinamool Congress were in an alliance, Mausam got 4,40,264 votes in Malda North while the CPM\u2019s Sailen Sarkar got 3,80,123 votes. The BJP\u2019s Amlan Bhaduri came third. In Malda South too, the BJP came third. This time, with the Congress and the Trinamool fighting separately, the BJP hopes to put up a tough fight.", "time_check": "2014-05-10 10:42:19", "url_a": null},{"time_pub_a": null, "domain": "www.timesofindia.com", "content_a": null, "title": "Woman gang-raped, killed by hubby", "url": "http://timesofindia.feedsportal.com/c/33039/f/533915/s/39da9870/sc/8/l/0Ltimesofindia0Bindiatimes0N0Ccity0Cpatna0CWoman0Egang0Eraped0Ekilled0Eby0Ehubby0Carticleshow0C343471920Bcms/story01.htm", "title_a": null, "domain_a": null, "time_pub": "2014-04-29 10:27:46", "time_check_a": null, "content": "SHEIKHPURA: A woman was allegedly gangraped and consequently murdered by her husband and his friends at a Sheikhpura village early Monday morning. \n\n\n\n The deceased, identified as the daughter of one, Jogi Mahto, a native of Bhadausi village under Korma police station area in Sheikhpura district, was married to one, Shiv Narayan Mahto of Pali village under Piropur PS area in adjoining Lakhisarai district a year ago.

A local boy, he has a bottomless treasure of Benarasi thumris, chaitis and kajris in his portfolio; his concerts are equal parts music and gyan. \n\n\n\n This year the buzz around him spilt in another direction. The day before his recital he agreed to be the proposer for Narendra Modi's nomination, claiming to be an admirer of the leader. He left some fans fuming. \"Why?\" sputtered one. \"Why not? Why shouldn't an artiste have a political view?\" countered festival regular Shailaja Khanna. \"Isn't his art giving him enough? Lanka mein gaye to Ravan se darna padega (if you go to Lanka, you will have to fear Ravan as well),\" sniped a senior vocalist. The man himself refuses to be provoked. \"I don't engage with politics but with personalities. BJP asked me respectfully. Modi has abhiman, not swabhiman. That is good enough for me to endorse him,\" says Mishra. \n\n\n\n Another classical star, santoor master Shiv Kumar Sharma, went to Amritsar to campaign for friend Arun Jaitley. This perhaps is the first election to have two prominent ustads engage in politics. \n\n\n\n So is the community of classical artistes shedding its insularity to articulate political views? The image of the aloof musician with no other concern than riyaaz is changing. Carnatic vocalist TM Krishna says it's a positive and signifi cant change. \"That politicians want classical musicians as campaigners is important recognition,\" says Krishna, who has written strongly against right-wing politics. Does this compromise integrity, artistic freedom? Krishna says theoretically an artist can take a clear political stand and retain artistic integrity. \"But will Shivji be able to publicly condemn BJP if one of its right-wing partners assaults a dancer or painter? That's the litmus test. Unfortunately, history shows us artistes are unable to separate their sense of artistic freedom and political preferences.\" \n\n\n\n Not that classical arts are immune to power of politics. State patronage of classical arts is a minuscule pie \u2014 competition for patronage intense, often vicious. Culture circuits are full of stories of artistes attaching themselves to patrons to lobbying for positions in culture bodies. But clear political alignment is new. \n\n\n\n Hindustani vocalist Vidya Shah believes music should not transgress into politics. \"That doesn't mean we cannot use music to dissent, seek solidarity or seek change. But taking a political position is polarizing because then you worry about doing what your patron wants.\" \n\n\n\n What the nature of this political engagement should be is being debated. Rahul Deshpande, one of Pune's whizkid Hindustani vocalists, says he has often questioned local leaders and administrators on city issues and was among a citizens group that campaigned to increase turnout. But he's wary of active politics. \"I admire Modi's administrative skills but that is about it. I would rather do my bit and stick to music,\" he says. \n\n\n\n How much of the party line artistes like Sharma and Mishra subscribe to remains unclear. \"They should be steady in their ideological stand even if I don't agree with it. This is a critical election \u2014 there can be no fence sitting,\" says Kathak dancer Aditi Mangaldas.", "time_check": "2014-05-11 08:33:20", "url_a": null},{"time_pub_a": null, "domain": "www.timesofindia.com", "content_a": null, "title": "Uninor woos first time voters with goodies", "url": "http://timesofindia.feedsportal.com/c/33039/f/533916/s/39e20433/sc/7/l/0Ltimesofindia0Bindiatimes0N0Cindia0CUninor0Ewoos0Efirst0Etime0Evoters0Ewith0Egoodies0Chome0Clok0Csabha0Celections0C20A140Cnews0C", "title_a": null, "domain_a": null, "time_pub": "2014-04-29 17:22:40", "time_check_a": null, "content": "AHMEDABAD: Uninor has launched a unique digital media campaign,Vote4win, in an effort to reach out to first time voters in the state and encourage them to exercise their right to self governance and choice. \n\n\n\n As part of the campaign, the company is encouraging first time voters to upload their selfies on popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

He enjoyed playing football, that was his outlet to express himself and his confidence on the pitch was in marked contrast to his generally shy personality. \n\n\n\n Whether there were millions watching around the world, it didn't seem to matter to him as he was self-absorbed in outwitting the opposition with his trickery. \n\n\n\n Now in his mid-twenties and a father to an infant son, he carries the responsibility of being the talisman for Barcelona and he is at a club where the fans worship him for what he has already delivered. \n\n\n\n It is different story for the Albiceleste. During a fruitful qualifying campaign, when he netted 10 goals, Argentines warmed to him but still Messi has to measure up to Maradona. \n\n\n\n The former Argentina captain and coach is an idol in his native country as many identify with him, the boy who emerged from the slums and restored national pride, notably with the two goals that knocked out England in the quarterfinals in Mexico in 1986. \n\n\n\n Messi will never have that connection with the fans, having been brought up in Spain after clubs back home allowed him to slip through their fingers. \n\n\n\n It was the Catalan side that put their faith in him as a 13-year-old and paid for him to have the growth hormone treatment that he needed to realise his full potential. \n\n\n\nLOOKING GOOD \n\n\n\n Coach Alejandro Sabella has built his side around Messi to a far greater extent than his predecessors and now at the peak of his career this could well be his best chance to emulate Maradona and bring the World Cup home. \n\n\n\n An attack-minded Argentina generally play with Messi alongside close friend Sergio Aguero in attack and Barca team mate Javier Mascherano controlling play in the middle. \n\n\n\n \"The team is looking good and we are getting on well together but in a World Cup anything can happen, it is very difficult,\" Messi said in the bulld-up to the finals. \n\n\n\n \"The games at the World Cup are totally different. First of all the atmosphere is not like anything else. While the Champions League is great, the World Cup is special.\" \n\n\n\n Messi is hoping to be 100 percent fit in Brazil having had a difficult 2013 due to a series of hamstring injuries. \n\n\n\n He spent a couple of months on the sidelines before returning in January and this could work in Argentina's favour as he may arrive fresher than other players. \n\n\n\n \"Apart from the obvious down side, it was good for me physically to have a two month break,\" Messi said. \n\n\n\n \"I was very relaxed working at the Argentine FA facilities. Then after that I went home to Rosario and worked hard there as well, so everything was good. \n\n\n\n \"To be home with friends and family, just to be there after so much time, is good for me.\"", "time_check": "2014-05-11 08:34:04", "url_a": null},{"time_pub_a": null, "domain": "www.timesofindia.com", "content_a": null, "title": "5.5-inch iPhone delayed till 2015: Report", "url": "http://timesofindia.feedsportal.com/c/33039/f/533923/s/39a6d8c8/sc/5/l/0Ltimesofindia0Bindiatimes0N0Ctech0Ctech0Enews0C50E50Einch0EiPhone0Edelayed0Etill0E20A150EReport0Carticleshow0C3410A61920Bcms/sto", "title_a": null, "domain_a": null, "time_pub": "2014-04-23 08:06:02", "time_check_a": null, "content": "NEW DELHI: iPhone fans may have to wait more to get their hands on the large-screen version of Apple's flagship smartphone. \n\n\n\n The 5.5-inch version of Apple iPhone has been delayed till 2015 according to a report by Taiwan's Industrial and Commercial Times. The report mentions that the Cupertino giant is struggling to find a battery that could fit in the new iPhone's thin form factor. Earlier, an analyst had suggested that the 5.5-inch iPhone would be launched in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, a Reuters report had stated that the 5.5-inch version of the iPhone could be delayed because of difficulties with in-cell production technology. \n\n\n\n As per the report, Apple suppliers are calling the 5.5-inch iPhone, 'iPhone Air' and not iPhone 6, but it's not certain that this will be the final name for the smartphone. It won't be surprising if Apple adds the 'Air' suffix to the name of the phone given that it is rumoured to sport a very thin profile. \n\n\n\n iPhone 6 is said to have a 64-bit A8 processor, 1GB RAM, LTPS LCD display panels, optical image stabilization, Touch ID fingerprint sensor, metal casings and NFC.
