# Newshub


This is a project sponsored by [Magic Grant](http://brown.stanford.edu/magic), seek funding made possible by the Brown Institue for Media Innovation at [Columbia](http://www.columbia.edu/) and [Stanford](http://www.stanford.edu/) University. We are building a system to track the censorship and inappropriate journalistic practice post-publication. We started this project because we want to better inform the readers and involve the public in monitoring online publications, to keep journalism accountable. We will also produce monthly reports and visualizations to help our readers better understand these changes. The project has a special focus on Asian countries. <br/>
