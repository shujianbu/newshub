# Newshub

Newsrooms deliver millions of articles each day. Many of which are updated as news stories develop. Aside from spelling corrections and story follow-ups, some media made changes to their stories under the pressure of government censorship or as a result of bribery from those in the news. Newshub aims at monitoring sensitive news, presenting readers the whole picture they deserve to see, and try to keep journalism accountable. The project has a special focus on Asian countries. 

This is a project sponsored by [Magic Grant](http://brown.stanford.edu/magic), seek funding made possible by the [Brown Institue for Media Innovation](http://brown.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University in the City of New York](http://www.columbia.edu/) and [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/) . <br/>

### Findings & Reports 

We will produce monthly reports and visualizations to show readers the data we collect over the month. In case of any scheduled or unexpected big events, we will also produce hot news report to track real time news stories. Bi-weekly summaries are also available in readersâ€™ request.
