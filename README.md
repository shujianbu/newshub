# Newshub


This is a project sponsored by [Magic Grant](http://brown.stanford.edu/magic), seek funding made possible by the [Brown Institue for Media Innovation](http://brown.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University in the City of New York](http://www.columbia.edu/) and [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/) . <br/>

In an era of booming information, news websites publish an average of 200 articles a day and changes are made to articles without any communication to readers. In many cases the reason is government censorship or exchange of money behind the scene. We are building a system to track censorship and inappropriate journalistic practice post-publication . We started this project because we want to involve the public in monitoring online publications and keeping journalism accountable. The project has a special focus on Asian countries. <br/>

### Setup 

```Python
  
  # sync the database
  python website/manage.py syncdb 
  
  # migration
  python website/manage.py migrate  
  
```

### Browser Addon 

The Browser addon will indicate whether an article is already in our database and whether changes have been made to the article. Readers will be able to add new articles and publications to our database and receive email alerts if they wish to.

### Findings & Reports 

We will also produce monthly reports and visualizations to help our readers better understand the data that we collect. Monthly reports will highlight publications that make major changes to their online articles with both stories and visualizations. We will also right individual stories on substantial changes related to important news events.
